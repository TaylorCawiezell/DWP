Deployment of Web Projects

#Deployment Plans for Protfolio Website

1. ###Before pushing content please verify the following:
    * Words are correctly spelled
    * Styles and content is sound and streamlined with current "look"
    * Make sure you dont repeat any previous code or have any unnecessary tags or content

2. ###After push has been made it will be looked at for staging, if the content meets the standard of the website it will be tagged

3. ###The tags will be looked at and review a second time before syncing with github and made into an official release.

###Emergency Code Fixes

####All emergency code fixes will be immideatly reverted to before release to avoid any further harm to the site.
